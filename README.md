# Analysis of Borrower Worthiness

As the volume of persons seeking loans has increased, lenders have become increasingly cautious about the applications approved for credit extension. The credit evaluation process has become long drawn, where the lender analyzes existing economy conditions and borrower attributes to gauge the chances of repayment. The process of borrower assessment can be enhanced with the use of machine learning techniques that can provide an insight into a borrower's ability to repay a loan based on historical data.

The project is based on the loan data of 2018 that aims to build linear and logistic regression models on Python to understand the relation between loan amount / credit rating with borrower attributes. The business goal is to develop a model that can provide an appropriate reflection of a borrower's ability to repay his/her loan in terms of the amount to be extended thereto and the credit rating.
